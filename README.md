# Flex_Index_IDP

Python function to calculate flexibility index from MD trajectories to understand structural ensemble description of DNA-binding intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs),
specifically HOX transcription factors.

This is a novel MD-derived metric to infer residue-wise flexibility in disordered regions, addressing the limitations of traditional MD analyses in describing disordered proteins.
